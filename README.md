# ORMAP Fabric migration project

I intend to collect project notes here.
So far I have taken the class and attended some meetings.

To-do list

* Convert existing data, starting in a FGDB
* Port from FGDB to Enterprise, maybe in dbo.SANDBOX?
* Run through some training exercise and get feedback
* Tune up based on feedback
* Switch from dbo.SANDBOX to dbo.Clatsop
* Continue refining tools

## Convert data
